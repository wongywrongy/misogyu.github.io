A quote by Hunter S. Thompson, a highly influential american journalist and author, from <cite>The Proud Highway: Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman</cite>. He committed suicide at the age of 67.

> We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and—in spite of True Romance magazines—we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely—at least, not all the time—but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness. - Hunter S. Thompson
