&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hi, I'm Kyle, an undergraduate Computer Science student studying at [San Jose State University](https://www.sjsu.edu). I've maintained a strong passion for coding and problem-solving since elementary school. I started with <cite>Logo</cite> and quickly advanced into <cite>Python</cite>, <cite>Java</cite>, and <cite>RobotC</cite>.

At SJSU, I'm eagerly expanding my knowledge of computer science and its mathematical applications. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex technical problems with creative logic, and find immense satisfaction in crafting unique solutions.

Beyond the classroom, I'm a member of the [Software and Computer Engineering Society](https://sce.sjsu.edu) and [Computer Science Club](https://www.acmsjsu.org) where I collaborate with peers and network with industry professionals. To balance my technical pursuits, I also joined the SJSU Automotive Enthusiasts club as I love cars! As well as the Badminton club, a sport that I love and can excel at!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My journey in computer science is just starting but I'm led on by curiosity and a desire for continuous learning. I'm excited to tackle new challenges, contribute to innovative projects, and make the most of my tenure here!
